# **Simple Calculator** 
This is a calculator. Its made for a school project so its pretty basic and doesnt have anything special compared to a normal calculator.
I probably wont be updating this or anything but eh it exists.

## Features
Supports basic math types such as +, -, *, / and %   
Supports 2 different numbers (for now might add support for more later)   
Has a easy to use UI
