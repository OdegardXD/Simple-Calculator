# **Simple Calculator**  
This is a calculator. Its made for a school project so its pretty basic and doesnt have anything special compared to a normal calculator.
I probably wont be updating this or anything but eh it exists.

## Features  
Supports basic math types such as +, -, *, / and %    
Supports 2 different numbers (for now might add support for more later)   
Has a easy to use UI   

## How it works  
When the user enters a number and clicks something like + or - it saves the first number as firstnumber and the math type as operation.     
Then after the user enters the second number 2 things can happen. If the user clicks Equals then it saves the second number and takes firstnumber and operation and the second number and does the calculation with the math type from the operation variable.     
If the user selects another math type then it quickly does the first calculation and then remembers the calculation as firstnumber then it sets the new operation as whatever the user selected.    
  
It utilizes Switch for the math type.
