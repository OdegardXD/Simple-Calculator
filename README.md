# **Simple Calculator**  
This is a calculator. Its made for a school project so its pretty basic and doesnt have anything special compared to a normal calculator.
I probably wont be updating this or anything but eh it exists.  
This was made in Visual Studio WinForms

## Features  
Supports basic math types such as +, -, *, / and %    
Has a easy to use UI   

## How it works  
When the user enters a number and clicks something like + or - it saves the first number as firstnumber and the math type as operation.     
Then after the user enters the second number 2 things can happen. If the user clicks Equals then it saves the second number and takes firstnumber and operation and the second number and does the calculation with the math type from the operation variable.     
If the user selects another math type then it quickly does the first calculation and then remembers the calculation as firstnumber then it sets the new operation as whatever the user selected.    
  
It utilizes Switch for the math type.  

## License/Copyright or whatever the pro's call it
I dont care. Copy paste my code if you want even tho its probably really bad code because im a beginner and know barely anything.   
If you do end up copying anyting then i wouldnt mind a credit.
